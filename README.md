# Team SoPets SEP Project Update

Date: 29 March 2025

## Summary

SoPets is a digital companion game designed to create a meaningful, stress-free bond between players and their SoPet, emphasizing authentic pet care experiences. Over the past two months, we have made significant progress, designing and animating various pet nature styles with mix-and-match capabilities. We built a mobile MVP featuring core pet-rearing mechanics and demonstrated real-time multiplayer pet-sharing via Bluetooth and other technologies. Additionally, we developed a proof-of-concept for seamless native desktop integration, allowing SoPets to exist within the userâ€™s workspace without disruption. To engage our audience, we also launched a project website to share updates and showcase our progress.

## Key Updates

- Designed and animated multiple pet nature designs and demonstrated the mix-and-match capabilities of the pets.
- Built a basic mobile application MVP that showcases basic pet-rearing features, and demonstrated the proof-of-concept for our online multiplayer pet-sharing mechanics, using Bluetooth and other realtime technologies.
