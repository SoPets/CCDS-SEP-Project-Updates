# Team SoPets SEP Project Update

Date: 29 March 2025

## Background

SoPets is not just another pet-rearing game—it’s a digital companion designed to create a meaningful, stress-free bond between the player and their SoPet. The game should be easy to play yet rewarding, emphasizing the growth and learning of new moves by the pet. All features must reflect real pet experiences—for example, hunger depletes to 0% only after 3 days, mimicking a real pet’s needs. This philosophy guides every mechanic to prioritize authenticity and player enjoyment without stress.

## Key Updates

- Designed and animated multiple pet nature designs and demonstrated the mix-and-match capabilities of the pets.
- Built a basic mobile application MVP that showcases basic pet-rearing features, and demonstrated the proof-of-concept for our online multiplayer pet-sharing mechanics, using Bluetooth and other realtime technologies.

- Built the proof-of-concept of native desktop integration of our SoPet, where the digital pet can seamlessly exist within the bounds of the user's desktop, without interfering with the other windows.
